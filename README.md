## Running the app

Inside the `server/` directory, run `npm i` then `npm start`. If successful you should see the message:

```
Server is now listening on port: 8080
```

Inside the `client/` directory, run `npm i` then `npm start`.

There are test .txt files that can be uploaded in the app. In the `client/src/components/UserInput/UserInput.jsx` file, there are some canned ban phrases and the default phrase can be changed by swapping out the index of `banPhrases` on line 16.
